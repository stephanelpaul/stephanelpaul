### 🚀 What I'm About

I'm a hands-on problem solver who thrives on turning ideas into working products.  
Whether it’s:
- architecting backend systems,
- building interactive frontends,
- or wiring up devops pipelines that ship code like clockwork...

I’m all in.

💡 Always learning.  
💻 Always building.  
☕ Probably on my 3rd coffee.
